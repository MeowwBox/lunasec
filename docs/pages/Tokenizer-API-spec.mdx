# Tokenizer API

LunaSec's modules call into this service.  If a LunaSec SDK is available for your programming language, we strongly recommend using it instead of calling this endpoint directly.

### Generating a client

The API is defined in an OpenAPI spec,  which means you can use the spec file and OpenAPI's generators to generate yourself a simple strongly typed tokenization client in almost any language,
even if we don't support it officially.
