You're interested in seeing what LunaSec is all about? Cool!

The easiest way is to check out our [Live Demo app](https://app.lunasec.dev). Just create a new user, input some data, 
and see what LunaSec is all about. (In reality, it just looks like a plain old' app, so you might want to 
[read our guide](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/pages/overview/demo-app/overview/) that explains what is so magical about 
it.)

Alternatively, if you're feeling like you'd like to check it out yourself, then you can run the same exact Demo App 
locally with just a single command.

```shell
npx @lunasec/cli start --env demo

# Note: You have to have Docker and NPM installed for that this to work.
```

### Want to add LunaSec to your app?
